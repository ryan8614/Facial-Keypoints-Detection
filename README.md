# Facial Keypoint Detection

## Overview
This project focuses on **Facial Keypoint Detection**, a computer vision task used in applications such as facial recognition, emotion detection, and augmented reality. The project involves data preprocessing, data grouping, and deep learning model design to detect key facial landmarks.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares facial images for training.
- **Data Grouping**: Organizes data for better generalization and model performance.
- **Model Design**: Implements a deep learning model to predict facial keypoints.
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch-based Training**: Uses modern deep learning frameworks for training and evaluation.

## Dataset
The project uses a facial keypoint dataset, typically containing images of faces with annotated keypoints. Ensure the dataset is available in the correct format before training.

## Installation
To set up the environment, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance:
```bash
jupyter notebook "Ficial Keypoint Detection.ipynb"
```

## Results
The trained model predicts key facial landmarks, which can be visualized on images for verification.

## Applications
- **Facial recognition systems**
- **Emotion detection**
- **Augmented reality**
- **Medical applications (e.g., facial analysis for health monitoring)**
